Certainly! Here's a more detailed description of the relations among the three tables:

    Restaurant Table:
        Attributes: restaurant_id (primary key), restaurant_name, restaurant_address, restaurant_contact

    Collect Request Table:

        Attributes: request_id (primary key), restaurant_id (foreign key), max_preservation_time, collection_status

        Relations:
            The "restaurant_id" column in the Collect Request table is a foreign key that references the "restaurant_id" column in the Restaurant table.
            This relation establishes a link between a collect request and the restaurant that created it.
            Each collect request belongs to one specific restaurant.

    Employee Table:

        Attributes: employee_id (primary key), employee_name, employee_email, employee_password, request_id (foreign key)

        Relations:
            The "request_id" column in the Employee table is a foreign key that references the "request_id" column in the Collect Request table.
            This relation allows an employee to be assigned to a particular collect request.
            An employee can be associated with only one collect request at a time.

To summarize:

    The Restaurant table holds information about different restaurants participating in the program.
    The Collect Request table stores details of each food collection request made by a restaurant, including the maximum preservation time and collection status.
    The Employee table contains information about the employees involved in collecting and distributing the food. The request_id field in this table establishes a connection between an employee and the specific collect request they are assigned to.

This structure allows you to track the collect requests made by restaurants, assign employees to those requests, and maintain the relationships between the entities involv

ed.
